					Our journey started from a simple and clear thought
				</Typography>

				<Typography variant='body1' sx={{ color: 'text.secondary' }}>
					Our journey started from a simple and clear thought Shopping in Bangladesh is a complex and time-consuming
					task that often becomes inconvenient for customers. Five major reasons contribute to these challenges:
				</Typography>

				<List>
					<ListItem>
						Severe traffic congestion in cities wastes a lot of time, making it more difficult for busy individuals.
					</ListItem>
					<ListItem>
						The absence of fixed prices for products confuses customers and increases the risk of potential fraud.
					</ListItem>
					<ListItem>
						It becomes difficult to verify the quality of products due to the dishonesty of many sellers. Customer
						satisfaction is not prioritized, as commitments and warranties are rarely honored, reflecting a lack of care
						for customers.
					</ListItem>
					<ListItem>
						Limited product variety restricts choices, and customers living outside urban areas often struggle to find
						the products they need, as they are not easily available in local stores.
					</ListItem>
				</List>

				<Typography variant='body1' sx={{ color: 'text.secondary' }}>
					To address these issues and provide customers with a hassle-free and enjoyable shopping experience, Our
					mission is focused on solving these problems and improving the shopping experience for all.
